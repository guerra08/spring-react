# spring-react
A simple Spring Boot backend with a React frontend.

## Tech

**Backend:**

Spring Boot using H2 for an in-memory database. Using web and jpa starters, and Lombok for cleaner code.

**Frontend:**

React with Material UI for visual components and Axios for HTTP requests. Using React's Context API to share common data and functions between related pages and components.

## Motivation

This project was motivated by future work oportunities and also by the desire to build a project using two technologies that I enjoy. It serves as a study and practice ground.
